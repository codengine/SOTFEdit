## v0.11.0

The biggest change by far in this release is the integration directly into the game and displaying the position of the
player, Kelvin and Virginia and in Multiplayer-Games - the position of the other players.

Moreover, this also allows the teleportation to any point where we have exact coordinates (x,y,z) ingame without having
to leave the game.

All you need is a plugin. You can find the instructions at "Companion -> Setup".

### Features

Companion (only works while connected)

- Added live teleportation for the player, Kelvin and Virginia without having to leave the game to any point with exact
  coordinates (x,y,z)

Other

  here"

### Bugfixes

- Fixed critical bug where ziplines were accidentally removed from the map if structures were modified
- Complete rewrite of the "Game Setup" tab, which should now work reliably
    - One major change is that if you switch the Game Mode, the "invalid" settings are removed. So, "Custom" to "
      Peaceful" will also disable enemy spawning for example.

- Fixed the tool to "Lit Fires" so that fires will now really burn

  open
